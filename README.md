# A Freelancing Web Application With User Management And Database
This is a python web application made for freelancers. This will save the time of freelancer developers to build a user management system all by their own.
### Freelancers can:
1. **Manage their clients with full control.**
2. **Create invoices and manage their data.**
3. **Insert, update and delete orders through customised admin portal.**
4. **Access payment data.**

Before writting the code, make sure that the standard libraries are installed and upgraded. And make sure you have a database coonection.

`pip instal --upgrade pip`

`pip instal flask --upgrade`

`pip instal flask_cors --upgrade`

`pip instal mysql-connector-python --upgrade`

Remember, this webapp ***assumes that you dont have any payment process API*** and hence is designed to crosscheck all payments physically.
For more convinience, reffer to [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) and [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/) documentation.
