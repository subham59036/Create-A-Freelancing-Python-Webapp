This is a python webapplication made for freelancers. Freelancers can:
1. Manage there clients with full control.
2. Create invoices and manage their data.
3. Insert, update and delete orders through customised admin portal.

Remember, this webapp assumes that you dont have any payment process API and hence is designed to crosscheck all payments physically.
For more convinience, reffer to Flask and MySQL documentation.
